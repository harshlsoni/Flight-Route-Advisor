**Flight Advisor System**

**Introduction**

The Flight Advisor System is a C-based application designed to assist users in finding the shortest or most efficient flight paths between cities. The system utilizes graph data structures to represent cities and their flight connections, making it ideal for analyzing routes and optimizing travel plans.

**Features**

Graph Representation: Cities and flights are modeled as nodes and edges in a graph.

Shortest Path Finder: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between two cities.

Cost Efficiency Analysis: Computes the most cost-effective route based on user preferences (distance, price, or time).

Dynamic Input: Allows users to add or modify cities and flight routes dynamically.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive CLI for easy interaction.
